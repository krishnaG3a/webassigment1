        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The site report describes my learning process of basic web development skills covered during this module.
            It refers to the code I wrote, including the HTML, CSS, design, and debugging done in the project.
            All through the term, I have had success and difficulties which have enabled me to understand
            how websites are created and improved.

        <h2>Learning Experience (Ups and Downs)</h2>
        <p>
            Learning HTML was easier at the beginning because it focuses on structure.
            Creating headings, paragraphs, navigation bars, and sections showed me the way a webpage would end and how
            everything is arranged. The CSS was more hard because a minor mistake could also mess up the whole structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes debugging can be frustrating when layout correction may involve missing semicolons in JavaScript code.
            incorrect selectors. Nonetheless, with the aid of browser developer tools and validators, it has been possible to identify
            errors functionality and how it can help me improve my code. Without a doubt, one of the biggest learnings for me was learning
            how the concepts of padding, margins, and borders relate.

        <h2>Development of the Site</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the term, my website grew from a single page into a multi-page portfolio including
            Home, Projects, Contact, videodemo and this Site Report page. I learn how to link between pages,
            Organize the files better and reutilize CSS to maintain consistent design across the site.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Decisions and UI</h2>
        <p>
           I decided to focus on having a clean interface design to make the website more friendly for its users.
           A non-serif font was used for easy readability, and all colours were kept the design is calm and professional. 
           The navigation bar is the same on each page so that users can navigate conveniently around the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got inspiration from the basic portfolio websites and the ones demonstrated in the lectures 
            and tutorials. I have avoided complex animations to make this website friendly to its visitors.

        <h2>Validation Evidence</h2>
        <p>
            Below are screenshots showing that my HTML and CSS files validate successfully using
            W3C validation tools.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
         In conclusion, I found this module very beneficial as it has enabled me to gain a great foundation in web development.
         Even with trial and error involved in this process, it increased my confidence levels in coding,design, and problem-solving skills. 
         I feel more confident in building and designing websites desing HTML and CSS.
